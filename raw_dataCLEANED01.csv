Include those kept in a garage, outdoor storage area, car, truck, or other motor vehicle."" Here are the results.",,,,
"In this analysis, income (mostly categorized as a percent of the federal poverty level) is aggregated by Census-defined family units. Analyzing income by family unit captures income available to a group of people who are likely sharing resources. However, family units may not be the appropriate measure for capturing eligibility for health insurance.  Eligibility for health insurance is more accurately estimated using ""health insurance units,"" which may be counted differently for different types of insurance (such as Medicaid or employer coverage).",,,"A household consists of all the people who occupy a housing unit. A house, an apartment or other group of rooms, or a single room, is regarded as a housing unit when it is occupied or intended for occupancy as separate living quarters. A household includes the related family members and all the unrelated people, if any, such as lodgers, foster children, wards, or employees who share the housing unit. A person living alone in a housing unit, or a group of unrelated people sharing a housing unit such as partners or roomers, is also counted as a household.","For attorneys general and insurance commissioners, only elected officials' political party is displayed.",,,,,"The number of deaths per 100,000 total population.",,Source: http://wonder.cdc.gov,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,"States are categorized from highest rate to lowest rate. Although adjusted for differences in age-distribution and population size, rankings by state do not take into account other state specific population characteristics that may affect the level of mortality. When the number of deaths is small, rankings by state may be unreliable due to instability in death rates.",,,,,,
"The U.S. Census Bureau's poverty threshold for a family with two adults and one child was $20,160 in 2016.  This is the official measurement of poverty used by the Federal Government, and the measure used for most poverty-based data presented on State Health Facts.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) produces simplified - but very similar - versions of these poverty thresholds called ""poverty guidelines"" that are used to assess eligibility for income-based programs such as Medicaid.
